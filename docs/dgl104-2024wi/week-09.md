# WEEK 9 (WEEK OF MARCH 5)
## LECTURE - DESIGN PATTERNS

### DESIGN PATTERNS
[Design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern) are reusable fragments of code that provide a solution to a specific - and typically well-understood - coding problem. On their own, in the sense of a program, design patterns don't really do anything; however, when applied to the correct problem domain they can provide safe and easy to maintain solutions that are immediately recognizable by other programmers or software engineers who are familiar with them. This is a huge advantage to the long-term maintainability of a codebase.  

You can think of design patterns as recipes for solving commonly encountered coding problems. Much like a recipe, a design pattern is not intended to be entirely prescriptive, but allows for some flexibility in its implementation. And, again like recipes, there are many different flavours of a single design pattern, often separated by specific programming languages, or families of programming languages. 

The design patterns presented in the following video are a couple of the more well-known and commonly encountered. The video below presents code in both Java and Kotlin, though there are plenty of examples online of implementations in other languages at [Refactoring.guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/) and at the [Learning JavaScript Design Patterns](https://jsdp.addyosmani.com/) code example site (this is a companion site to the associated text, so there is less description; you'll have to dig into the browser developer tools to see the examples, or follow the links back to GitHub).

## ACTIVITIES

<!-- ### [REQUIRED] READ THE COMMUNITY CODE ASSIGNMENT
Make sure to visit the description of the Community Code assignment on Brightspace. You should read the assignment description and the rubric in detail to familiarize yourself with expectations.

### [RECOMMENDED] READ THE RESEARCH AND REFLECTION GUIDE -->

### [REQUIRED] READ "HOW TO CONTRIBUTE TO OPEN SOURCE"
GitHub's [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/) site includes a guide titled ["How to Contribute to Open Source"](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/), which is a fantastic overview of the variety of contributions that may be possible in healthy open source communities. The guide is written a bit like a how-to, so that you have an opportunity to put into practice what you learn as you read.

#### To complete this task (~45 minutes):
1. Read the complete ["How to Contribute to Open Source"](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) guide
2. Read section 2 ["What it means to contribute"](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#what-it-means-to-contribute) especially carefully, and consider how you might like best to contribute to an open source project. Keep in mind the requirements of the Community Code assignment.
3. Read section 4 ["Finding a project to contribute to"](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#finding-a-project-to-contribute-to) especially carefully and follow some of the suggested links (i.e. [GitHub Explore](https://github.com/explore/), [Open Source Friday](https://opensourcefriday.com/), etc.) and examine some of the projects that you see there.

Write a short summary and reflection in your Research and Reflection Journal that describes what you've learned about open source contributions and the ways in which you'd like to contribute.

### [REQUIRED] FIND POTENTIAL PROJECTS TO CONTRIBUTE TO
This activity requires you to find three potential projects that you might be interested in contributing to. Remember that ["contribution" can mean many things](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#what-it-means-to-contribute) and doesn't necessarily mean writing complex code.

#### To complete this task (~60 minutes):
1. Visit one or all three of [Good First Issue](https://goodfirstissue.dev/), [Up for Grabs](https://up-for-grabs.net/#/), and [CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/). You can stick with just one site, or use all three (I recommend spending time with all three). Play around with the search and filter functionality to find projects that interest you and, in particular, you should consider searching or filtering on the **proramming language that you chose last week** for the Community Code project.
2. Identify **three** projects/repositories that you think are interesting and complete a short analysis of each by doing the following:
    1. Open the [checklist](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#a-checklist-before-you-contribute) provided in the ["How to Contribute to Open Source"](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/) guide.
    2. Go through the checklist for each of the three projects you identified and check the boxes when appropriate. Take a screenshot when you have completed all checklist questions (you may need to zoom out your browser window). You also need to reset the checkmarks/page for each of the three projects.
    3. Write a short summary about each project and what you've discovered during your analysis in your Research and Reflection journal. Make sure to write down the url and point out any very interesting discoveries.

### [RECOMMENDED] EXPLORE COMMUNITY CONNECTIONS
Most well-known open source projects are supported by well-established communities, typically housed on async messaging platforms like Discord, Slack or Zulip. Even less well-known (but active!) open source projects are likely to have some connections back to other communities (either directly, due to particular tools or languages used, or indirectly through contributor involvement).

Spend some time researching community connections extending out from one or more of the projects identified in the last activity. If you find the community "home" right away (i.e. if it's as obvious as, for example, a Discord server) then spend some time familiarizing yourself with the community. If finding a community is harder, then follow as many relevant links from the repository back to potential communities that you can find (this might include looking carefully at maintainer GitHub profiles, websites and socials). Write a summary of your discoveries in your Research and Reflection Journal.

### [REQUIRED] IDENTIFY ISSUES TO SUPPORT
> Note that it might take more than one try to find an appropriate issue for this activity. Keep trying, but if you run into too many dead ends don't hesitate to reach out for help!

For this activity you will revisit the projects discovered in the last activity to identify specific issues that you believe you may be able to contribute to. Remember that  ["contribution" can mean many things](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#what-it-means-to-contribute) and doesn't necessarily mean writing complex code.

#### To complete this task (~60 minutes)
1. Visit the GitHub repository for each of the three projects that you have identified in the "Find Potential Projects to Contribute To" activity above and open the Issues tab.
2. Take a look at the different tags available under the "Labels" dropdown. Note down any tags that you think might contain interesting issues, including the "good first issue" or "help wanted" tags.
3. Read through the available issues tagged by "good first issue" or "help wanted" tags (or any other that you think is interesting). Identify at least one issue that you think you might be able to support / contribute to.

    > I want to pause here and say that the two most important measures of whether or not you think you could contribute to an issue is: if you _understand_ what the issue is saying, and if you have an idea where you might start to look for solutions. 

4. For each identified issue write a summary of the issue in your Research and Reflection Journal. Your summary should include a url, a brief description of the issue, and an explanation of how you think you can contribute (or, at least where you would start). Make sure to summarize any discussion that might have already occurred between community members in the issue. 

### [REQUIRED] WRITE A SUMMARY ON SLACK
Share a summary on Slack of **one** of the issues identified in the "Identify Issues to Support" activity. Make sure you include a link back to the issue/repository, briefly describe the project/repository, and clearly explain why you think this issue is potentially a good one for you to contribute to. 

### [RECOMMENDED] FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS AND REFLECTIONS
1. What is the most surprising thing that you've learned about open source development and/or open source communities during your research this week?
2. What types of open source projects do you find yourself most drawn to? Is there an obvious connection between them? 
3. Is the programming language that you chose last week still the right choice? Should you consider alternatives?
