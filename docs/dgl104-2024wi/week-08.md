### COMMUNITY CODE
Identify the community site that you think will be the most valuable for you to regularly engage with throughout the semester. Make a user profile and introduce yourself in a 'new members' (or similar) forum. Do the following:
- Read through some recent threads.
- Make a list of topics that you are interested in.
- Bookmark / favourite / star any threads you want to continue to follow.
