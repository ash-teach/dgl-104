# WEEK 8 (WEEK OF FEBRUARY 26)
## MID-SEMESTER UPDATE
Now that we've gotten through the first half of the semester we'll shift gears a bit. To date, we have spent time with foundational ideas about good coding practice, including topics such as documentation, code review, refactoring, debugging and testing, which we have explored through weekly required and recommended work, the Programming Practice Article assignment and the MIT App Inventor assignment. The concepts we've explored and the work we've done serve as a foundation for the rest of the term, where we will explore functional requirements, design patterns, architectures and programming paradigms. In the coming week we'll commence work on the Research and Reflection Journal assignment and the Community Code assignment, which will draw on those foundational concepts covered in the first half of the term, and on new knowledge generated in the second half of the term.

Most critical to this is a shift to the type of coding work that we'll be doing. In the first part of the semester we focused on MIT App Inventor to ensure a common experience and so that we could easily and rapidly develop mobile apps. While we will continue to use `AI2` as a tool to demonstrate some key architectural ideas, most of your coding work will now be centred on a particular language of your choice. The work you do with this language will be drawn from our conceptual topics, and will be embedded in your Research and Reflection and Community Code assignments. 

More details on both assignments will be available on Brightspace.

## LECTURE - FUNCTIONAL USER REQUIREMENTS

### USER STORIES
To develop _useful_ apps the developer must have an understanding of user needs; however, it is common for software (or apps) to be developed by people who are not precisely the target end-users of that software (or, the developer may be a potential end-user, but perhaps represent only a small fraction of the target audience). 

There have been many [design-based methods and tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-centered_design) developed to address this and related issues. We will focus on the method of generating [user stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story) in order to identify potential project requirements with the intention of developing functional user requirements that serve as a stronger technical foundation for development (see [functional user requirements](#functional-user-requirements) below).

A user story is a short statement written from the perspective of a user that describes a particular use of the software under development. Typically, user stories begin with "As a user..." and go on to explain what the user would expect of the software in a specific context. Generating user stories can help the developer empathize with the end-user by better understanding end-user needs and motivations. While rarely technical in nature, these stories can help the developer to generate clear specifications for software features and uses, especially if there is an associated opportunity for consultation with potential end-users via focus group, or similar.

### FUNCTIONAL USER REQUIREMENTS
User stories enable a user-centred approach to the development of functional requirements. For our purposes, functional requirements will serve as the clear technical specifications of a software (i.e. app) feature that we would like to implement, although we might like to go a step further to define a complete technical specification or other document.

Not all features are equally suited to be described by functional user requirements. Where it is possible, however, implementations are much more rigorous and are drawn directly from the specification with very little ambiguity. This is a huge help to early stage development.

## ACTIVITIES

### [RECOMMENDED] READ THE RESEARCH & REFLECTION ASSIGNMENT
Make sure to visit the description of the Research & Reflection assignment on Brightspace. You should read the assignment description and the rubric in detail to familiarize yourself with expectations.

> The next two activities (each a research and reflection activity) are practice for what you will be doing on a regular basis in your Research and Reflection Journal assignment. The key difference is that for that assignment, I won't always post prompt questions for you to respond to - you must take some initiative yourself in writing your own questions to research and reflect on. 

### [REQUIRED] RESEARCH A NEW LANGUAGE
> I recommend you do this activity in pairs, or in a group of three, if you can arrange it.

To practice the notion of research and reflection you will do a bit of research to learn more about one of the following programming languages: [Processing](https://processing.org/), [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), or [Lua](https://www.lua.org/).

#### To complete this task (~30 minutes):
1. Choose **one** of the three programming languages above; preferably one that you have never heard of before.
2. Answer the following questions about your chosen language:
    - What is the language used for?
    - Who uses the language?
    - What are some useful resources?
    - Why are these specific resources useful?
3. Post a short summary (a paragraph or less) on Slack that answers one or more (your choice) of the questions above and that is *different* from any other Slack post (i.e. the first to post have the advantage!)

I don't expect your answers to the questions above to be *complete* (i.e. when you tell me what the language is for, I don't expect you to tell me all of its uses), but you should be *specific*. In other words, if you tell me that Processing is used for database management (protip: it isn't) then you should show some evidence by pointing to a project website or repository. Similarly for the who, the what the the why questions.

### [RECOMMENDED] REFLECT ON SLACK NEW LANGUAGE RESPONSES
In theory, by the end of the week we should have a couple dozen or more responses on Slack to the required activity above. Take some time to read them, then write a short reflection on Slack stating what you've learned from the process. When writing your reflection consider both the research you've done and what you've learned in reading other posts. Your reflection need not be more than a paragraph, and can be a stand-alone post, or a reply to another post.

### [REQUIRED] WRITE A USER STORY
> I recommend you do this activity in pairs, or in a group of three, if you can arrange it. 

#### To complete this task (~20 minutes)
Pick out an app that you use regularly and choose a feature to write a user story about. You may begin by writing a relatively general user story, but you should endeavour then to write a collection of more specific user stories for the same feature. Consider writing about different contexts, or different uses (i.e. users with different motivations). You can also try to write some acceptance criteria (i.e. a checklist of qualities or properties that should be present in the feature for it to be "accepted").

As an example, imagine a generic messaging app:
- "As a user, I can open a contact list to send a message."
- "As a user, I can open a contact list from a new message text field."
- "As a user, I can add new contacts to my contact list."

Acceptance criteria for the last of these user stories may include:
- The contact list includes an 'Add new contact' button.
- The contact list clearly displays all existing contacts.
- The contact list provides a fast scroll (or similar) navigation tool for parsing long contact lists.

### [REQUIRED] CHOOSE A LANGUAGE FOR COMMUNITY CODE
The Community Code project requires that you spend time writing code in service of an open source community. The code you write need not necessarily be shared with that community, but you should write code with the community in mind. What code you write will be determined by course content, community needs, and your choice of programming language.

For this task you should spend time thinking about what language you might like to work with for the remainder of this course. I recommend that you consider using a language you are already familiar with and preferably one that is closely associated with mobile or web app development. This is also an opportunity to learn more about your chosen language, so think of it as a learning opportunity.

**Good choices include:**
- (Taught in DGL programs): Kotlin, JavaScript, React Native, PHP  
- (Not taught in DGL programs): TypeScript, Swift, Dart, Ruby

**Less good choices include:**
- Java - in part because the Java communities tend to cater less to novices, and because more folks write apps in Kotlin than Java these days.
- HTML or CSS - are markup and style sheet languages, respectively. Our goal is to focus on general purpose programming languages.

#### To complete this task (~30 minutes)
Write a Slack post that includes the following:
- The language you’d like to focus on (see list above for suggestions)
- The amount of experience you have with it (i.e. semesters, years, project - whatever makes to you)
- One specific reason why you’d like to learn more about the language

### [REQUIRED] STAR GITHUB TOPICS AND REPOSITORIES OF INTEREST
In preparation for the Community Code project I'd like you to familiarize yourself with some communities of interest on GitHub. Doing so will help to increase the breadth of your knowledge of open source communities, and will give you a good starting point when searching for a community to contribute to.

#### To complete this task (~20 minutes)
1. Visit the [GitHub Explore tab](https://github.com/explore) on your profile (make sure you are logged in!)
2. If there is anything in your Explore feed, scroll through to see what GitHub is suggesting you follow. Star anything that looks interesting!
3. Click the [Topics tab](https://github.com/topics), scroll through the list (it's pretty long, and you'll have to press Load more...) a bunch of times. Star any topics that look interesting.
4. Click the [Trending tab](https://github.com/trending). Keep scrolling and starring! If you want to narrow what you see play with the filters at the top of this list.
5. Click the [Collections tab](https://github.com/collections) and browse through the items. This list is shorter, but clicking on each will open a curated list of repositories on that subject, which - you guessed it! - you can star if you think they're interesting.
6. Finally, head back to the [Explore tab](https://github.com/explore) and scroll through now that you've starred a bunch of interesting repositories. You should see some new content!

### [RECOMMENDED] FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS AND REFLECTIONS
1. What is one interesting thing that you've learned from researching about programming languages and from reading other students' posting about programming languages in response to the first activity?  
2. What other programming languages might you consider to work with for DGL 104? What are your second choices, and why?
3. What did you find most interesting when examining repositories on GitHub? Is there anything that surprised you, or that you didn't expect? What similarities are there across some of the repositories you've starred?
