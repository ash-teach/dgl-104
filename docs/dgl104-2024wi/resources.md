# Resources <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

## Community Code Sites <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
- [GitHub Topics](https://github.com/topics) - star topics that you find interesting in the list (as well as repositories that you find interesting) and then visit the [GitHub Explore](https://github.com/explore) section to get some personalized suggestions.
- [First Contributions](https://firstcontributions.github.io/) - a collection of repositories that have "good first issue" tags. Be aware that many of these *probably* assume that you have developer-level programming skills in a particular language, but don't let that dissuade you! It might still be a good place to look for communities.
- [For Good First Issue](https://forgoodfirstissue.github.com/) - similar to the above, but picks out "good first issue" tags on projects that have been tagged as [Digital Public Goods](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/digital-public-goods/).
- [GitHub Global Campus](https://education.github.com/events) - the central hub for all things education at GitHub.
