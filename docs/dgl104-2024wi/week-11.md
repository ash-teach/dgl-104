<!-- ## ACTIVITIES
### RESEARCH
- Determine if your chosen programming language is OOP capable. To what extent does it support OOP? Fully, or partially? Does it support any other paradigms? 
- Find a style guide for your chosen programming language. Who is the style guide for? Is there an overarching purpose to the style guide? Is the style guide easy to read and understand? 

### REFLECT
- Consider your own programming practice: What do you think you do well, and where do you think you could improve? If you have access to prior code-based assignments examine them carefully to assess strengths and weaknesses.
- Consider your documentation practices: What have you done well? What could be improved? If you have access to prior assignments examine your documentation approach and consider what works and what doesn't.

### COMMUNITY CODE
Identify the community site that you think will be the most valuable for you to regularly engage with throughout the semester. Make a user profile and introduce yourself in a 'new members' (or similar) forum. Do the following:
- Read through some recent threads.
- Make a list of topics that you are interested in.
- Bookmark / favourite / star any threads you want to continue to follow.

## ACTIVITIES
### RESEARCH
- In continuation from last week, what other languages that you know (or might be learning) are OOP capable? Compare and contrast last week's language with your choice this week. 

- Determine if your chosen programming language is OOP capable. To what extent does it support OOP? Fully, or partially? Does it support any other paradigms? 

### REFLECT
- Consider your use of GitHub in previous classes, or outside of school. What do you feel you understand well? What do you feel completely in the dark about? How are you going to improve your understanding?

### COMMUNITY CODE
This week should be about getting into the code base of your chosen community and even about writing some simple code. In particular, you should think about writing code to help you better understand what your community's code base does:
- If there are tutorials available, try one out. Make sure you *experiment* with the code and *discuss* this experimentation in your documentation. 
- If you feel comfortable with your programming language or chosen framework already then you could choose a piece of the code base to experiment with. This should include cloning the code base locally and examining it in your IDE of choice.
- If your community has an issue tracker (e.g. GitHub Issues) then take a look through to see if you can find a good issue (ideally one tagged as '"good first issue" or similar) that you can experiment with. -->
