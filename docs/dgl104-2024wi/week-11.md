# WEEK 11 (WEEK OF MARCH 18)
## LECTURE - OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
The following videos outline some key considerations in object-oriented programming (OOP). Many of the ideas in the first video should be familiar to you, while the second video will likely present some new ideas. Primarily, we examine these ideas in _contrast_ to functional programming paradigm, which is our final topic of the semester, presented in week 12.

## ACTIVITIES

### [RECOMMENDED] CONNECT WITH YOUR EXTERNAL COMMUNITY
Last week you started work on your selected issue for your external community. This week I recommend that you take some time to engage with your community, if you haven't yet done so. Seek out community outlets, such as Slack, Discord and Zulip, and introduce yourself, if you haven't already done so. If you would like to do so, explain that you are working on a project for a college course and that you are interested in contributing. 

Making connections like this can be stressful, but if you are able to do so it's a great way to gauge how welcoming a community is. If you receive a positive response then you know you're in the right place; if you receive no response at all, then perhaps another community would be a better one to devote your time to. 

### [REQUIRED] READ THROUGH PATTERN LIBRARY ISSUES
Our second [pattern-library milestone](https://github.com/nic-dgl104-winter-2024/pattern-library/milestone/2) was yesterday, the goal of which was to ensure we had a complete accounting of all possible issues that should be completed before the deadline at the end of the semester. At the completion of this milestone the backlog should be locked and we should add no more new issues (except as possible stretch goals) to ensure we have a good chance at completing what remains.

#### To complete this task (~30 minutes)
1. Visit the [pattern-library issues](https://github.com/nic-dgl104-winter-2024/pattern-library/issues) tab and read through all open issues. 
    - Please comment on issues that you have an opinion on (an issue need not be assigned to you for you to comment on it!)
    - Request to be assigned to issues (first priority should be unassigned open issues; second priority should be to issues that already have assignees)
    - Keep note of anything that you think is missing and please feel free to [open a new issue](https://github.com/nic-dgl104-winter-2024/pattern-library/issues/new) if there is something you think is missing!
2. Visit the [pattern-library pull requests](https://github.com/nic-dgl104-winter-2024/pattern-library/issues) tab and read through all open pull requests.
    - Please comment on any pull requests that you have an opinion on (a pull request need not be assigned to you for you to comment on it!)
    - Request to be assigned to pull requests if you can provide a code review, or if you are able to test the given code.
3. Take a look at other similar pattern library repositories (there are a few noted in [comments in issue #1](https://github.com/nic-dgl104-winter-2024/pattern-library/issues/1#issuecomment-1980263348)) and identify anything we might like to add to our repository.

Make sure to record the actions you've taken on the above in your Research and Reflection journal, and please do send me an email or message if there is something you'd like to add or see changed.

### [REQUIRED] CONTINUE CONTRIBUTIONS TO EXTERNAL COMMUNITY
If all is going well with the issues identified last week for your external community, then please continue to work on those issues.

On the other hand, if you have run into problems, or cannot otherwise complete the issue that you have identified, please don't throw your work away! The work you have done is equally valid, and even if you haven't completed solving an issue, you can still include the work you've done in your CONTRIBUTING.md document.

#### To complete this task (~60 minutes):
1. If you have been successful in working on your identified issue, please continue.
2. If you have run into problems and can't continue, then please do the following:
    - Compile all information that you collected in attempting to solve the issue and write about it in your CONTRIBUTING.md file.
    - Make sure to include all relevant and supporting links in your CONTRIBUTING.md documentation (i.e. to the original issue, to any attempts you made in your fork, to any relevant documentation or commentary)
    - Describe the challenge you faced, and why it became a block to your progress. Describe any attempts to solve the block, or explain why solving it was impossible.
    - Reflect on any successes and describe how they will help you in the future.

After you have completed work on your issue (either by completing it, or by hitting a roadblock and reflecting on it as described above) then you may move onto completing a second issue!

### [REQUIRED] CONTRIBUTE TO PATTERN-LIBRARY
By now you should have at least one [pattern-library](https://github.com/nic-dgl104-winter-2024/pattern-library) task assigned to you. Please continue work on this, and be vocal! Update the class with any comments on the issue or PR comment thread, and remember to commit regularly.

As with your chosen external repository, please move on to a new issue once you have completed any assigned to you.

### [REQUIRED] FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS AND REFLECTIONS
1.  Determine if your chosen programming language is OOP capable. To what extent does it support OOP? Fully, or partially? Does it support any other paradigms? Wikipedia has a good list of [multi-paradigmatic programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_multi-paradigm_programming_languages).
