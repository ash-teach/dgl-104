# WEEK 12 (WEEK OF MARCH 25)
## LECTURE - FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING
### FUNCTIONAL PARADIGM
If you haven't caught on yet - I love functional programming! :D  And these days, [lots](https://spectrum.ieee.org/functional-programming) of [other people](https://github.com/readme/featured/functional-programming) do [too](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-developers-are-falling-in-love-with-functional-programming-13514df4048e). Most notably, although functional programming has long been thought of as a tool of academic research labs, functional languages and tools are more and more frequently used to support web and mobile app development, typically via [backend](http://suave.io/) [support](https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2020/10/27/delivering-social-change-with-elixir-at-change.org/), but [even](https://haskell.dev/article/Building_web_applications_with_Haskell_A_beginners_guide.html) for [front-end](https://elm.land/) [development](https://clojure-doc.org/articles/tutorials/basic_web_development)!

In this class, our interest is less in the use of functional languages directly, and more in the use of functional _tools_, by which I mean specific types of _functional-style_ APIs (typically related to collections, like arrays, lists, etc.) that offer methods such as `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`. Most modern program languages (including Java, Kotlin, Swift, JavaScript and a whole host more) offer API methods like these to increase code efficiency relating to collection-based computations and programs. I strongly encourage you to consider adopting these types of methods where appropriate, rather than using imperative-style loops, to make your code more concise and beautiful!

## ACTIVITIES

As the last week of the Community Code project I encourage you to spend your time completing any outstanding tasks left on your plate. The deadline for submission is posted as Feb. 28th, but I will accept submissions up until Apr. 3rd, leaving the final few days next week for completion of the Research and Reflection journal.

### To submit your Community Code assignment:
The Community Code assignment dropbox on Brightspace asks for a text submission. Please include a link to your Research and Reflection Journal and to **your** fork of your Community Code Part 1 external repository. I will be looking _specifically_ for evidence of work completed for Part 1 and Part 2 (likely in the form of bulleted lists), and reflections on your work for _both_ Parts 1 and 2 (as required by the assignment description).

> **Please ensure that you provide links to _all_ actions that you have taken - including all actions taken on pattern-library contributions! I will not be able to easily search for all your individual contributions, so whatever you submit via this method is what I will grade!**

I will not be reviewing your Research and Reflection Journal as part of this submission, other than the  lists of contributions and the required reflections (see the assignment description for more info).
