<!-- ## ACTIVITIES
### RESEARCH
- Determine if your chosen programming language is functional programming capable. To what extent does it support functional? Fully, partially, or not at all? Are there any functional-like tools (e.g. functions, methods) that replicate some functional behaviours?
- What Git tools are available to your IDE or code editor of choice? Is there a GitHub integration? Are features provided natively in the IDE / editor, or through a plugin / extension? Is there a diff tool available?  

### REFLECT
- What device constraints have you experienced in your own mobile device usage? Have you experienced any pain points, or friction in the use of a device? Do you use any accessibility features, or are there any accessibility features that you wish were available (considering either your usage, or a friend's usage)?
- How has your Git knowledge improved in the last few weeks? In the last few months? What is one area of Git that you know little about, or that you are confused about?  

### COMMUNITY CODE
At this you should *start* formulating a clear idea how you would like to contribute to your community; your idea need not be complete right now, but you should be at the stage of being able to articulate at initial steps. If you are having trouble with this check out the list of ideas in the assignment description.

You should also have in hand some code representing a handful of hours of work: This could be a continuation of the code experimentation started last week, or it could be a completely new path. Whether this code is 10 lines or 100 isn't important, but you should be able to demonstrate (through documentation or presentation) what that code represents in your learning process.


### COMMUNITY CODE
By this week you should be thinking about the steps you need to take wrap up the your community code assignment. This means ensuring that you have a distinct contribution, clear documentation and justification, and any additional supports where needed. This is also a good time to consider refactoring for clarity, idiomatic approaches, or to conform to your community's style expectations.

The code that you have produced for this project is likely more extensive than the specific code you intend to point to as your actual community contribution. For example, you may have completed multiple tutorials, or produced a number of coding experiments along the way to help you better understand your community and your goals. The final code that represents the community contribution might be relatively small (a couple dozen lines, for example) but is backed up / supported by all the other code you've written as part of this project. You should submit all the code you have produced to an appropriate repository, but you need only make your contribution well-organized, well-written and properly documented. -->
