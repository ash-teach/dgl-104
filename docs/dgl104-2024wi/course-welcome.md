Welcome to **DGL 104: Application Development Foundations**! This course is part of a series of mobile app development courses offered by the department of [DIGITAL Design + Development](https://www.nic.bc.ca/programs/arts-science-and-management/digital-design-and-development/) at [North Island College](https://nic.bc.ca) for the [Web and Mobile App Development diploma](https://www.nic.bc.ca/programs/arts-science-and-management/digital-design-and-development/web-and-mobile-application-development-diploma/) and related programs.  

DGL 104 is a first-year, second-semester course that follows an introductory programming course (typically **CPS 100: Computer Programming I**, but other courses may be acceptable as prerequisite) and is typically offered concurrent to **DGL 114: Introduction to Mobile App Development**. The second year in the progression includes **DGL 204: Programming for Mobile App Development**, **DGL 213: Applied JavaScript** and **DGL 214: Advanced Mobile App Development**.

DGL 104 occupies a theory-oriented space in the progression listed above. Each of the other courses in the progression focuses on the practical application of specific programming languages or tools in the development of mobile or web apps. DGL 104, however, focuses more on good programming practices, open source development and principles, software architecture and design patterns, and ethical issues in computing and mobile app development. As such, DGL 104 is treated a programming language *agnostic* course, meaning: students must possess foundational programming knowledge and skills, but any programming language would suffice for background knowledge.

## WHAT YOU WILL LEARN IN THIS COURSE
---
The learning outcomes defined for DGL 104 state that on completion of the course a student will be able to:
1.	describe how platform-based development differs from general purpose programming;
2.	recall software design principles including separation of concerns, information hiding, coupling and cohesion, encapsulation and others;
3.	investigate the impact of software design choices on app design and functionality;
4.	describe an interactive system in terms of a model-view-controller and related patterns;
5.	model a simple application given an appropriate design paradigm;
6.	implement simple applications based on design models and established principles;
7.	apply a variety of strategies to the testing, debugging and refactoring of simple programs.

These outcomes are wide ranging, but you can probably infer two distinct themes running through them: 1. Good programming practice; and 2. Developing applications. Let's look at both of these in more detail, including how I will work to contextualize them within real-world concerns:

### GOOD PROGRAMMING PRACTICE
The idea of good programming practice is a concept that permeates *all* programming courses: No programming instructor wants you to develop skills that lead to poorly written or formatted code, and these and related ideas will be no less critical to DGL 104. However, I take the idea of "good practice" a couple steps further by directly relating this idea to community-driven development in open source software. My goal in this course is to help you develop not only the skills needed to write clean code, but also the skills needed to make development with community-oriented goals in mind a part of your *daily* programming practice.

### DEVELOPING APPLICATIONS
As an early sequence course in the development of mobile apps you won't be developing highly complex apps using the latest and most cutting edge hardware devices. However, you will explore the foundational concepts of app development, especially relating to the typical mobile app interaction model, by developing simple apps using the [MIT App Inventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu/). Although App Inventor uses a [block-based editor](https://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/designer-blocks), rather than a more traditional fully-featured programming language, many of the concepts you'll learn in this course have a direct relationship to App Inventor apps. Furthermore, I'll motivate your work in App Inventor by piggybacking on the App Inventor values pertaining to developer empowerment and apps for positive social and democratic change.

This site, hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and built using the [Docsify Open Multicourse Starter Kit](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-multicourse-starter-kit) is intended as an open educational resource (OER) licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a> (except where otherwise noted) and so is free to use by anyone, not only registered students of DGL 104. 

### IF YOU ARE AN NIC STUDENT REGISTERED IN DGL 104... 
you will get the most value out of this site by *reading* and *watching* the assigned content *in advance of* scheduled class time for that week. Doing so *with intention* will sufficiently prepare you for class each week, where you can expect to dig into the topics presented here in more detail.

Each week's content also includes some activities for *research*, *reflection*, and are often related to major course assignments. In most cases, you will complete these activities in class; however, spending some time considering them in advance will mean you are better prepared at class time. I may, from time to time, also assign these activities as homework to be completed outside of class.

### IF YOU ARE NOT REGISTERED IN DGL 104...
or are not even an NIC student, please feel free to use this content as you see fit.

 # REQUIRED SOFTWARE
* A web browser and reliable connection. Much of the work we'll do is web-based, including lecture videos and readings, optional videos and readings, and activities involving [MIT App Inventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu/).

* A programming language environment - this course is programming language-agnostic, meaning you can do [most] of your programming work in any language you prefer. For most of you, I expect this will mean the language you are most recently familiar with (likely Java or Python), but others of you may choose to use a language you are just learning (like Kotlin, or JavaScript).

* An IDE for your chosen language - an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), or at least an extensible code editor (such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or [JetBrains Fleet](https://www.jetbrains.com/fleet/)) is necessary for many of the tasks you'll perform in this course.

* A GitHub client - or the Git CLI, however you prefer to commit, push and pull code to and from GitHub. Some good options are [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/) (which is free with a [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)).
