## ACTIVITIES
### APP INVENTOR
Begin implementing your App Inventor app ideas this week. By the end of week 9 you should have built enough of your app that it can be tested and critiqued. At this stage you need not worry too much about the architectural approach that you will take - remember that this can be handled later in refactoring; however, you should work to have most of the user interface in place before class time next week.

Some advice:
- Keep your idea (and app) small! It's much easier to build-on features later.
- Focus on the user experience to begin with.
- Write some user stories to generate design and UI ideas, and convert these to functional requirements to get a sense of what technical challenges you might face.

Feel free to use any tutorials that you find as resources to help you out with the development of your app - just make sure you cite them as resources!

### FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS AND REFLECTIONS
Answer the following questions in your Research & Reflection Journal once you've done some work on your App Inventor project:

1. Did the development of the UI of your app proceed smoothly? Or were there unexpected challenges?
2. To what degree did you do design work (possibly in other classes, like DGL 111) to support the development of your app? How helpful was this design in the process of development?
3. How do you anticipate that your app code may change as you continue development? Do you anticipate that you will use any design patterns or architectural patterns?


## ACTIVITIES
### RESEARCH
- Determine if your chosen programming language is OOP capable. To what extent does it support OOP? Fully, or partially? Does it support any other paradigms? 
- Find a style guide for your chosen programming language. Who is the style guide for? Is there an overarching purpose to the style guide? Is the style guide easy to read and understand? 

### REFLECT
- Consider your own programming practice: What do you think you do well, and where do you think you could improve? If you have access to prior code-based assignments examine them carefully to assess strengths and weaknesses.
- Consider your documentation practices: What have you done well? What could be improved? If you have access to prior assignments examine your documentation approach and consider what works and what doesn't.

### COMMUNITY CODE
Identify the community site that you think will be the most valuable for you to regularly engage with throughout the semester. Make a user profile and introduce yourself in a 'new members' (or similar) forum. Do the following:
- Read through some recent threads.
- Make a list of topics that you are interested in.
- Bookmark / favourite / star any threads you want to continue to follow.
