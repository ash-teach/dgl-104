# COURSE ASSIGNMENTS <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
The following provides a high-level description of assignments to be completed in this course. Each of these assignments is designed to compliment content covered throughout the course, and to provide you with a vehicle for demonstrating your mastery over the course learning outcomes.

---
## PROGRAMMING PRACTICE ARTICLE <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
### OBJECTIVE <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
To write a compelling article on a topic of your choice in line with course learning outcomes.

### DEADLINE <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
Week 6 (Week of February 12)

### WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
A key method of demonstrating good programming practice is to write an article that expands upon a topic of interest that we cover in the early semester. This article must demonstrate value to a potential future learner in this course, or in a related course. The article must be well-researched and must include references to any sources you use to develop the article. The article must also include code, either as demonstration of good coding practices, or in the form of a tutorial. 

At minimum, your completed article must:
- Include around 1000 words of text (this is negotiable, but does *not* include code blocks - see below).
- Have a well-defined value for a potential future learner in this course.
- Have a well-defined introduction and conclusion or recommendations for further study.
- Include at least four multi-line blocks of example code (this is negotiable: You could have more shorter blocks, or fewer longer blocks). 
- Include a properly formatted list of all *sources* used in your article.

### SUGGESTIONS AND STRATEGIES <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
- Contributions for this assignment must be substantial. This assignment runs from week 1 to week 6 and encompasses in-class activities and homework activities. In total, you should be able to account for on the order of 10 hours of work over the duration of this assignment.
- Keep lots of notes! Demonstrating your process is a key component of the project (see the Brightspace rubric).
- Be sure to write down your sources! Doing so as you proceed with research will be much easier than trying to track them down later.

## APP INVENTOR PROJECT <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

### OBJECTIVE <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
To demonstrate skill in app development using appropriate design paradigms.

### DEADLINE <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
Week 6 (Week of February 12)

### WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
Our first steps in the practice of developing apps will begin on day one of class. However, you will not develop apps using native Android or iOS technologies, but rather by use of the [MIT App Inventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu/), an  [open source](https://github.com/mit-cml/appinventor-sources) visual and blocks-based programming tool that can be used to develop simple (and even somewhat complex!) apps. 

Your goal will be to adopt some portion of the paradigmatic app design approaches, and / or software architecture models, as presented in this course in the development of a an app using MIT App Inventor. This process will include peer review (both code and usability), refactoring and testing processes to ensure a well-documented development process and a smooth user experience. All development progress on your app must be recorded and documented in a GitHub repository.

This assignment is contextualized in part by ethical considerations in app development, in humanitarian goals, and in app development for "social impact" as outlined on the [MIT App Inventor About page](https://appinventor.mit.edu/about-us). 

### SUGGESTIONS AND STRATEGIES <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
---
- Part of the operating goal of the MIT App Inventor project is to *democratize* app development tools; meaning, MIT App Inventor has been designed with simplicity and accessibility in mind, so that even young children have an opportunity to build a working app. For students of DGL 104, who already have some programming and possibly some development experience, learning even some advanced uses of MIT App Inventor should be fairly approachable. That said, don't assume you'll be able to pull something together quickly last minute without prior efforts!
- Some class time will be devoted to learning the use of MIT App Inventor. If you need more, however, there are many [tutorials](https://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/tutorials) available!
- You can choose to log into the MIT App Inventor site with a Google account. If you prefer to remain anonymous there is an alternative log in method that allows you to [log in with a randomly generated code](http://code.appinventor.mit.edu/login/?locale=en) that you must save to resume your work.

## RESEARCH AND REFLECTION JOURNAL <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
### OBJECTIVE <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
To produce a portfolio of research and reflection related to course content.

### DEADLINE <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
Week 14 (Week of April 8)

### WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
We'll be adopting a reflective process as part of all work done in DGL 104. With each day's class, all homework, and each assignment you'll be asked to record goals, strategies and process, then reflect on successes and failures after completion. In the latter half of the course (after reading break) will formalize this as an assignment, which you will work on in collaboration with your community code project.

### SUGGESTIONS AND STRATEGIES <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
- Research and reflection opportunities are provided during the first half of the semester mainly to prompt good habits. Keep up with these opportunities, and this assignment will be a breeze in the second half of the semester.
- You can record your responses in any modality you wish (written or otherwise recorded) as long as at least a link can be posted to a GitHub repo.

## COMMUNITY CODE PROJECT <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
### OBJECTIVE <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
To engage good coding practices in support of a specific open source development community.

### DEADLINE <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
Week 14 (Week of April 8)

### WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
Throughout the latter half of the semester you will be guided through lecture and activities to join an open source community of your choice (and that hopefully coincides with your interests!) in order to support that community through active engagement and good coding practices. The material outcome of this assignment is code that you produce in your chosen language that is intended - perhaps in only a minor way - to *contribute* to your community, but that *also* demonstrates good coding practices and engagement with interests and concerns outside of your program of study.

What constitutes *contribution* is dependent on your community, your level of programming expertise, and the amount of time you can devote to this project. The following is a non-exhaustive list of examples ordered from most approachable (i.e. easiest) to most challenging (i.e. hardest):
- Improved code documentation (which would include *code examples* for demonstration).
- Answering community questions (if you are part of a novice or beginner community you may have access to a beginner forum; if you have sufficient knowledge in your community you can answer questions for other novices - just make sure you *write code* to support and demonstrate that your answer is correct!).
- Partial or complete tutorial (imagine writing a *coding tutorial* for your community that you wish you had had when you first joined)
- Translation / localization of a code base (many open source projects are multi-lingual, but don't always have fluent coders in target languages; make sure you are *writing translated code* as part of this).
- Contribute to open issues or pull requests on GitHub (this could include *writing code* for bug fixing or feature development).

You will record all progress and work completed for this assignment in a GitHub repository with a well-organized and detailed README.md file.

### SUGGESTIONS AND STRATEGIES <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
- Notice that I've been specific (in *italics*) in each example above in terms of how you might *write code* in your contribution. **It is a requirement that you write code** for this assignment; however, it is *not* a requirement that you share your code with anyone other than me. In other words, you should be able to justify how the code you write *could* help your community, but you need not share it publicly, if you're not comfortable doing so.
- Contributions for this assignment must be substantial and weekly engagement is expected. This assignment runs from week 8 all the way to week 14 and I expect that you will continue to work on this assignment outside of class time as homework. In total, you should be able to account for on the order of 20 or so hours over the course the semester devoted to this assignment. 
- Create your GitHub repository early and use the repository README.md file to track progress. Keep careful notes on your progress, as this will help you in self-evaluations!
- Some communities have a well-defined hub of activity (like a Slack, Discord or Zulip channel, or a forum of some sort), and others will be more decentralized. Part of your work in identifying your community will be in identifying the main resources you will rely on through the semester.
- Clearly articulating for yourself what you think the goals of your chosen community are can help to keep your code project on track.
- Consistently maintaining documentation is a key component to demonstrating your learning journey in this assignment.
