## ACTIVITIES
### RESEARCH
- Examine tools in your IDE/ editor of choice that support debugging. What features are supported? Linting? Breakpoints? Stacktraces? Exception handling? Are these handled natively by the IDE / editor, or through a plugin or extension? 
- Search your community to find a direction on writing either a bug report or other issue. How clear are the directions? How strict are the directions? Are there consequence for not following directions? 

### REFLECT
- When has debugging been particularly challenging? Consider a project that you've worked on in the past where a bug was particularly difficult to solve. What techniques did you use? Knowing what you know now, would you be able to improve your process? How is what you've recently learned going to help you in the future? What debugging techniques will you adopt?

### COMMUNITY CODE
This week and the following weeks will consist of primarily incremental improvements to your community code assignment. These improvements may include (but are not limited to): 
- additional precision in your contribution idea; 
- code improvements that more specifically support your community;
- documentation improvements that more specifically demonstrating your learning progress, and the relationship between your code and your contribution idea. 



## OPTIONAL CONTENT
### So You Think You Know `window.open` - Jessica Campos
If you don't know any JavaScript and haven't spent a lot of time with the [DOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model) some of what goes on here will be over your head. However! What we're most interested in here isn't the technical details, but the **experimental approach** that Jessica uses to explore code and features that she has little experience with.
