## ACTIVITIES
### RESEARCH
 - Compile a list of useful UI pattern resources that are most helpful from a development perspective (i.e. resources that specify not just how a UI might be designed, but also how it might be coded). Feel free to use resources from other courses (i.e. especially DGL 111). Which of your resources do you think will be most useful? Are there any gaps?
- Search for a resource that provides a collection of design patterns (and / or anti-patterns) in your chosen programming language. Choose one pattern and examine it closely. What is the pattern for? In what situations would you expect to find it? What are the key elements of the pattern? What have you learned from your close examination?

### REFLECT
- On your own use of mobile apps. What types of UI work well for you? What do you find difficult? If there were changes that you'd like to see made to a particular app, what would they be? How would you frame the requirements for these changes in terms of technological requirements?
- Have you compiled a library of useful code snippets that you might find helpful in future projects? What code have you included and why? If you haven't yet started such a library, what snippets do you think you would include and why?
### COMMUNITY CODE
By this week you should be thinking about the steps you need to take wrap up the your community code assignment. This means ensuring that you have a distinct contribution, clear documentation and justification, and any additional supports where needed. This is also a good time to consider refactoring for clarity, idiomatic approaches, or to conform to your community's style expectations.

The code that you have produced for this project is likely more extensive than the specific code you intend to point to as your actual community contribution. For example, you may have completed multiple tutorials, or produced a number of coding experiments along the way to help you better understand your community and your goals. The final code that represents the community contribution might be relatively small (a couple dozen lines, for example) but is backed up / supported by all the other code you've written as part of this project. You should submit all the code you have produced to an appropriate repository, but you need only make your contribution well-organized, well-written and properly documented.
