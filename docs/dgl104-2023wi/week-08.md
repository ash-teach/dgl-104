## MIT APP INVENTOR
The following videos are brief tutorials on the use of MIT App Inventor (officially, it's "MIT App Inventor 2", so I'll refer to it as `AI2` from now on). The apps developed are fairly simplistic, but the demonstrations of the user interface are a great introduction to the use of AI2.

## ACTIVITIES

### LOGGING IN TO MIT AI2
The [main MIT AI2 site](http://appinventor.mit.edu/) has many great resources available. You can access AI from this site (click on the big orange `Create Apps!` button in the upper left), or you can visit the [AI2 site](http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu) directly.

#### LOGGING IN WITH GOOGLE <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
Logging into AI2 __requires__ a Google account. You can choose to use an existing account, or you can create a new one. Logging in with a Google account has the benefit that your projects are saved under a username and password model, so that you can easily retrieve them. 

#### LOGGING IN WITH A ONE-TIME CODE <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
Alternatively, if you prefer not to use a Google account you can access AI2 using a one-time code. Visit [this alternative site](https://code.appinventor.mit.edu/login/) and press the 'Continue without Google' button:

</div>
Once AI2 loads you will be provided with a one-time four-word code. __Write this code down!__

</div>

In order to access your work in the future you will need to enter this code in the login screen, as pictured below:

### \[OPTIONAL\] AI2 SPACE INVADERS APP
The MIT App Inventor [Space Invaders tutorial](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/space-invaders) is a fun one to get started with. The tutorial is marked as 'intermediate' but with your prior experience in programming it should be closer to easy for you - with the caveat that finding all the right components and blocks might be tricky.

YOu can see the completed tutorial file on our GitHub organization in the [SpaceInvaders repository](https://github.com/nic-dgl-104-winter-2023/SpaceInvaders). If you want the practice, I recommend going through the tutorial, but if you need some help you can examine the code in the repository. To use it:

- Clone the [SpaceInvaders repository](https://github.com/nic-dgl-104-winter-2023/SpaceInvaders) (or download the `.aia` file directly).
- Open AI2 (as per login instructions above).
- Choose the `Projects > Import project (.aia) from my computer...` menu item.
- You should now be able to see the SpaceInvaders project by choosing the `Projects > My projects` menu item.

### \[IN CLASS\] MAP IT
We'll be running through the [MapIt tutorial](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/displaying-maps) in class, but in case you fall behind you can follow the directions above, or you can find the completed code in our GitHub organization in the [MapIt repository](https://github.com/nic-dgl-104-winter-2023/MapIt).

### AI2 RESOURCES
- [Getting started resources](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/get-started)
- [AI2 tutorials page](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/tutorials)
- [Artificial Intelligence with AI2 tutorials](http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai-with-mit-app-inventor)
- [Built-in blocks reference](http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/reference/blocks/)
- [Components reference](http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/reference/components/)


### FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS AND REFLECTIONS
Answer the following questions in your Research & Reflection Journal once you've completed one or more of the tutorials above (whether on your own time, or in class):

1. Are the UI elements in the completed app (Space Invaders or Map It) sufficient? Is there anything missing, or anything that seems unnecessary?
2. Choose one UI element in the completed app and write a __user story__ to represent it (see [Functional User Requirements](dgl104-2023wi/week-08#functional-user-requirements) video above).
3. Transform your user story into a __functional requirement__ specification (see [Functional User Requirements](dgl104-2023wi/week-08#functional-user-requirements) video above).
4. Examine the code blocks in the completed app with a critical eye. How could the code blocks be improved, based on what you've learned about good programming practice?

### COMMUNITY CODE
By this week you should be thinking about the steps you need to take wrap up the your community code assignment. This means ensuring that you have a distinct contribution, clear documentation and justification, and any additional supports where needed. This is also a good time to consider refactoring for clarity, idiomatic approaches, or to conform to your community's style expectations.

The code that you have produced for this project is likely more extensive than the specific code you intend to point to as your actual community contribution. For example, you may have completed multiple tutorials, or produced a number of coding experiments along the way to help you better understand your community and your goals. The final code that represents the community contribution might be relatively small (a couple dozen lines, for example) but is backed up / supported by all the other code you've written as part of this project. You should submit all the code you have produced to an appropriate repository, but you need only make your contribution well-organized, well-written and properly documented.
