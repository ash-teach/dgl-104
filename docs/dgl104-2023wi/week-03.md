## ACTIVITIES
### RESEARCH
- In continuation from last week, what other languages that you know (or might be learning) are OOP capable? Compare and contrast last week's language with your choice this week. 
- Examine an API or library supporting your chosen programming language. What do you notice in particular about the documentation approach the author's take? Is the documentation clear? Well-organized? Do you think you'd be able to find what you're looking for?

### REFLECT
- Consider your use of GitHub in previous classes, or outside of school. What do you feel you understand well? What do you feel completely in the dark about? How are you going to improve your understanding?

### COMMUNITY CODE
This week should be about getting into the code base of your chosen community and even about writing some simple code. In particular, you should think about writing code to help you better understand what your community's code base does:
- If there are tutorials available, try one out. Make sure you *experiment* with the code and *discuss* this experimentation in your documentation. 
- If you feel comfortable with your programming language or chosen framework already then you could choose a piece of the code base to experiment with. This should include cloning the code base locally and examining it in your IDE of choice.
- If your community has an issue tracker (e.g. GitHub Issues) then take a look through to see if you can find a good issue (ideally one tagged as '"good first issue" or similar) that you can experiment with.
