# WELCOME TO DGL 104 APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT FOUNDATIONS!
Welcome to the course! On this site you will find links to all course resources and direction on how to approach your work each week, and for each course assignment. Course videos, which will provide additional direction and details, will be hosted exclusively on the course [Brightspace site](https://mycourses.nic.bc.ca/d2l/home).

The first thing you should do is familiarize yourself with what is available to you on this site - did you know this is actually a [GitHub pages site](https://github.com/ash-teach/dgl-104)? It's built using [Paul Hibbitts'](https://github.com/paulhibbitts/) excellent [Docsify Open Multicourse Starter Kit](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-multicourse-starter-kit), an open source project you can fork yourself, if you like. For students enrolled in DGL 104 at North Island College you *should* view this course through [Brightspace](https://mycourses.nic.bc.ca/d2l/home), but you can check it out [directly on the web]((https://github.com/ash-teach/dgl-104)), if you wish.

If you're entirely new to Brightspace you might want to check out some of the resources on [LearnAnywhere](https://learnanywhere.opened.ca/), North Island College's site devoted to student support for online learning. There is a whole section devoted to [Brightspace](https://learnanywhere.opened.ca/digital-technologies/brightspace/) that might be of help if you run into any trouble navigating the interface.

Once you've familiarized yourself with the course site and contents you should read the [syllabus]() and watch the course welcome videos. Then it's time to start installing software! See the [Required Software](#required-software) section below, and watch the video if you need a bit of help.

I'm really excited about this course and what we're going to accomplish this semester! 

 
 # REQUIRED SOFTWARE
* A programming language environment - this course is programming language-agnostic, meaning you can do [most] of your programming work in any language you prefer. For most of you, I expect this will mean the language you are most recently familiar with (likely Java or Python), but others of you may choose to use a language you are just learning (like Kotlin, or JavaScript).

* An IDE for your chosen language - an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), or at least an extensible code editor (such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or [JetBrains Fleet](https://www.jetbrains.com/fleet/)) is necessary for many of the tasks you'll perform in this course.

* A GitHub client - or the Git CLI, however you prefer to commit, push and pull code to and from GitHub. Some good options are [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/) (which is free with a [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)).
