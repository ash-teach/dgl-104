## ACTIVITIES
### RESEARCH
- Search for any code review resources in your community. How detailed / extensive is the resource? How well does the resource fit the process proposed in lecture? Do you think there are any improvements to be made (in either direction)? If you can't find a direct resource, consider examining discussion on open and closed pull requests in your community.

### REFLECT
- How have you refactored code in the past? Has it been intentional, or opportunistic? How does this related to your typical commit strategy? How could what has been discussed in class have helped you to perform a better refactor in past projects? 
- Consider code reviews that you've done in the past. What has worked well about the process? What could have been improved? Where could the process potentially fail?

### COMMUNITY CODE
This week and the following weeks will consist of primarily incremental improvements to your community code assignment. These improvements may include (but are not limited to): 
- additional precision in your contribution idea; 
- code improvements that more specifically support your community;
- documentation improvements that more specifically demonstrating your learning progress, and the relationship between your code and your contribution idea.
