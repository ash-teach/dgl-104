## ACTIVITIES
### RESEARCH
- Determine if your chosen programming language is OOP capable. To what extent does it support OOP? Fully, or partially? Does it support any other paradigms? 
- Find a style guide for your chosen programming language. Who is the style guide for? Is there an overarching purpose to the style guide? Is the style guide easy to read and understand? 

### REFLECT
- Consider your own programming practice: What do you think you do well, and where do you think you could improve? If you have access to prior code-based assignments examine them carefully to assess strengths and weaknesses.
- Consider your documentation practices: What have you done well? What could be improved? If you have access to prior assignments examine your documentation approach and consider what works and what doesn't.

### COMMUNITY CODE
Identify the community site that you think will be the most valuable for you to regularly engage with throughout the semester. Make a user profile and introduce yourself in a 'new members' (or similar) forum. Do the following:
- Read through some recent threads.
- Make a list of topics that you are interested in.
- Bookmark / favourite / star any threads you want to continue to follow.
