# WEEK 9 AND 10 (WEEKS OF MARCH 6 AND 13)
**NOTE:** This is some of the most complex, but critical content of the course, so we will take two weeks to explore the topic in detail.

## ACTIVITIES
### APP INVENTOR
Begin implementing your App Inventor app ideas this week. By the end of week 9 you should have built enough of your app that it can be tested and critiqued. At this stage you need not worry too much about the architectural approach that you will take - remember that this can be handled later in refactoring; however, you should work to have most of the user interface in place before class time next week.

Some advice:
- Keep your idea (and app) small! It's much easier to build-on features later.
- Focus on the user experience to begin with.
- Write some user stories to generate design and UI ideas, and convert these to functional requirements to get a sense of what technical challenges you might face.

Feel free to use any tutorials that you find as resources to help you out with the development of your app - just make sure you cite them as resources!

### FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS AND REFLECTIONS
Answer the following questions in your Research & Reflection Journal once you've done some work on your App Inventor project:

1. Did the development of the UI of your app proceed smoothly? Or were there unexpected challenges?
2. To what degree did you do design work (possibly in other classes, like DGL 111) to support the development of your app? How helpful was this design in the process of development?
3. How do you anticipate that your app code may change as you continue development? Do you anticipate that you will use any design patterns or architectural patterns?

### COMMUNITY CODE
**The Community Code project is due in week 11** so you should be in the process of starting to final and wrap up the project. If you've made some contributions already then you can consider the documentation you might need to do to fully support your work. If you haven't made any contributions yet then please do make that a priority!
