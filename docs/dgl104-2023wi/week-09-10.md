# WEEK 9 AND 10 (WEEKS OF MARCH 6 AND 13)
**NOTE:** This is some of the most complex, but critical content of the course, so we will take two weeks to explore the topic in detail.
## LECTURE - MV* PATTERNS

## ACTIVITIES
### RESEARCH
- Find an example of a specific implementation of either MVC or MVVM in your chosen language. Clone the code and examine it to mark the critical components associated with the pattern. Draw a diagram that represents how binding is achieved and that demonstrates the separation of model and view. Note that the particular implementation you choose might not precisely match the in-class presentation.

### REFLECT
- Consider the diagramatic way in which software architecture patterns are typically presented. Have these been helpful to your understanding? Have they hindered your understanding? Is there a better approach? If so, describe it; if not, explain what you think the strength of the diagramatic approach is.


### COMMUNITY CODE
Wrap up week! Please ensure you project is properly documented and organized and clearly distinguishes between the community contribution and all other code written. If you haven't done so already, you should be pushing all your code up to an appropriately named repository on our DGL 104 GitHub organization. This is necessary, as I will expect you to point to specific aspects of your community code project as part of your self-evaluation.
