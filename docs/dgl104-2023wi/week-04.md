## ACTIVITIES
### RESEARCH
- Determine if your chosen programming language is functional programming capable. To what extent does it support functional? Fully, partially, or not at all? Are there any functional-like tools (e.g. functions, methods) that replicate some functional behaviours?
- What Git tools are available to your IDE or code editor of choice? Is there a GitHub integration? Are features provided natively in the IDE / editor, or through a plugin / extension? Is there a diff tool available?  

### REFLECT
- What device constraints have you experienced in your own mobile device usage? Have you experienced any pain points, or friction in the use of a device? Do you use any accessibility features, or are there any accessibility features that you wish were available (considering either your usage, or a friend's usage)?
- How has your Git knowledge improved in the last few weeks? In the last few months? What is one area of Git that you know little about, or that you are confused about?  

### COMMUNITY CODE
At this you should *start* formulating a clear idea how you would like to contribute to your community; your idea need not be complete right now, but you should be at the stage of being able to articulate at initial steps. If you are having trouble with this check out the list of ideas in the assignment description.

You should also have in hand some code representing a handful of hours of work: This could be a continuation of the code experimentation started last week, or it could be a completely new path. Whether this code is 10 lines or 100 isn't important, but you should be able to demonstrate (through documentation or presentation) what that code represents in your learn.

### RecyclerView Pseudocode exercise
1. Create some sample data that includes:
    - Student name
    - Student ID
    - Courses for which the student is currently enrolled 
    
    Data points can be written in any way that you choose - remember that the data points aren't actually how the data is represented in code; the data representation in code is via the model.
2. Write a class to model the data. The class should contain:
    - A constructor that builds an instance of the class from the given data points
    - Class members, or variables that can be used to access the data points.
    - You could include some behaviour if required by your language (for example, Java typically requires getter methods to access class data)
3. Write a representation of the view. You can use HTML to do this, even if it's not relevant to your programming language:
    - Write some HTML that displays each view appropriately
    - Use HTML `<div>` tags to organize views appropriately
    - Try to use semantically correct HTML tags where possible (i.e. use `<ul>` to display a list)
