# COURSE ASSIGNMENTS
The following provides a high-level description of assignments to be completed in this course. Additional detail and direction will be provided during regularly scheduled class time.

Each of these assignments is designed to compliment content covered throughout the course, and to provide you with a vehicle for demonstrating your mastery over the course [learning outcomes](dgl104-2023wi/week-01#what-you-will-learn-in-this-course).

As a DGL 104 student you will submit completed assignments to the DGL 104 Brightspace shell, through which I will provide you with feedback for improvement. At mid-semester and end-of-semester you will collect all submitted assignments and my feedback and write a self-evaluation on your progress, which will form the basis of your final grade.

If you are not registered in DGL 104 feel free to follow along by completing the assignments below - but you'll have to find a friend to review your work and provide you with feedback!

## COURSE GOALS
### OBJECTIVE
To think critically about what you hope to achieve from this class.

### DEADLINE
Week 2: Initial document
Week 5: First check-in
Week 7: Second check-in
Week 9: Third check-in

### WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO:
Over the course of a couple weeks:
1. Make sure you read/watch all the course informational content
2. Idea generation: Grab your favourite brainstorming tools (mind maps are great!) and start recording ideas relating to your goals. Don't worry about editing ideas - just write down what comes to mind!
3. Take a break! Maybe for 10 minutes, maybe for a day, maybe for a week - just make sure you leave space between idea generation and idea evaluation.
4. Idea evaluation: Revisit your brainstorm. Circle or mark the things you find most compelling. Maybe talk to a friend, if you have someone willing to listen.
5. Idea expansion: Pick a small number of ideas (between 2 and 4) to expand on. Write, or record, more of the specifics relating to the idea and why it is compelling to you.
6. Idea reflection: Write a document / presentation / poem / whatever, or record a video / livestream / whatever you like that explains your goals in clear language. At this stage you may still have too many goals (hopefully not too few!), but we can continue to refine them from this point on. This reflective process may also help to clarify which ideas are most important to you, and which can be dropped.

### SUGGESTIONS AND STRATEGIES:
- Start early, but do this over multiple sessions. Your goals will be much better articulated if you take time to let the ideas you come up with process before trying to pin them down. 
- Don't worry if you don't have quite the right idea for your goals - like I said, you donâ€™t yet know what you don't know!
- Be brave! Take some risks! If you find your goals are too lofty, we can always revise later!

## RESEARCH AND REFLECTION JOURNAL
### OBJECTIVE
To produce a portfolio of research and reflection related to content covered.

### DEADLINE
Ongoing. Complete research and reflection work weekly and submit at mid-semester and end-of-semester.

### WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO:
1. Read / watch all lecture content assigned for the week.
2. Read the RESEARCH and REFLECT prompts for the week. Complete the associated activities. 
3. Record your answers to the prompt questions in a GitHub repository.

### SUGGESTIONS AND STRATEGIES:
- You can record your responses in any modality you wish (written or otherwise recorded) as long as at least a link can be posted to your process portfolio repo. Your Slack summary, however, must be text to facilitate easy discussion.
- Your Slack summary can include responses either to both RESEARCH and REFLECT, or just to one of the two.
- Including images in your Slack summary is acceptable, and encouraged if it helps communicate what you've learned.
- Use proper formatting in your process portfolio repo (check out README.md formatting syntax!); use triple backticks (```) to create code blocks in Slack if posting code.
